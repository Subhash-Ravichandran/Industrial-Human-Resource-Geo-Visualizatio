# Project Name: Industrial Workforce Analysis

## Problem Statement:
In India, understanding the distribution of the workforce across various industries is crucial for economic planning and policy-making. However, existing data on industrial classification is outdated, hindering accurate analysis of employment trends. The aim is to update and analyze industrial workforce data to provide insights for policy-making and employment planning.

## Approach:
1. **Data Integration:** Merge provided CSV files to create a comprehensive dataset.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyze data to understand its structure, quality, and relationships.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features and perform natural language processing to categorize industries.
5. **Model Building:** Apply machine learning models to predict workforce trends and industry categories.
6. **Model Testing:** Evaluate model performance and refine as needed.

## Results:
- Developed a dashboard app using Streamlit and Plotly for visualizing workforce population across industries and geographies.
- Analyzed facts and figures to provide insights into industrial workforce distribution and trends.

## About Dataset:
The dataset contains state-wise counts of main and marginal workers classified by industry and gender. Industries include manufacturing (plastic, rubber, chemicals), construction, retail, etc.

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly and Matplotlib for visualization
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text analysis
- Streamlit for dashboard development

## EDA Insights:
- Distribution of workforce across industries by state and gender.
- Trends in employment patterns over time.
- Regional variations in workforce distribution.
